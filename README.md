# Introduction to SQL üóÑÔ∏è

Hey there! üëã

Welcome to the **Introduction to SQL** course! This course is designed to help you get started with SQL, the language used to interact with relational databases.

Just like the Python course, you don't need to install anything. The code runs on **Databricks**, which provides a cloud-based environment for running SQL queries and managing data.

## Files Explained üìÑ

For each lesson, there are two types of files:

- **`.ipynb` files**: These are interactive notebooks that can be opened in Databricks or compatible environments. They contain both explanations and SQL code cells, allowing you to read the notes and run the queries directly.

- **`.py` files**: These are plain Python scripts containing the SQL code from the lesson, often embedded within Python comments or strings. They are useful if you prefer to run the code in a different environment or want to focus solely on the SQL queries.

## Course Outline üìö

Here's a brief overview of what each lesson covers:

### **[Lesson 0: Tables](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bzznrc/SQL-101/blob/main/0_Tables.ipynb)**

- **Files**: `0_Tables.ipynb`, `0_Tables.py`
- **Description**:
  - Learn how to create and populate tables.
  - Understand data types and table schemas.
  - Set up the initial data we'll use throughout the course.

### **[Lesson 1: Select](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bzznrc/SQL-101/blob/main/1_Select.ipynb)**

- **Files**: `1_Select.ipynb`, `1_Select.py`
- **Description**:
  - Master the basic `SELECT` statement to retrieve data.
  - Learn how to filter data using `WHERE`.
  - Explore sorting results with `ORDER BY` and limiting output with `LIMIT`.
