    "We saw how our data is rarely in the right format and we might need to group it and apply aggregate functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, it doesn't end there. Most times our data is also scattered in different tables, and we often need to put it back together.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not like this because data people are bad and want you to suffer (or not just that). Let's consider our example:\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we worked on the **Transactions** table, but usually you get a bunch of them, linked in what is called a **Fact-Dimension** relation. In our case:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transactions** is our **Fact** table‚Äîit records what \"happened\", in this case a purchase. It includes keys that allow you to look up details in the other tables (the Dimension ones).\n",
    "- **Product** is one of the **Dimension** tables. It's accessed with the `sku_id` and it lists all the features of each SKU.\n",
    "- **Store** is the other **Dimension** table, and links to the Transactions one via the `store_id` field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are the data arranged like that? Why don't we just have a big table that includes all the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple technical reasons, but the main ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Size**: The **Product** table in our toy example is very tiny. But in reality, it could easily have 20/30+ columns. Now, for an item such as *Berillo Spaghetti N.5 500G*, you have just one line with these 20/30+ columns filled. If all the data was instead in the main **Transactions** table, every single transaction would have 20/30+ extra columns, and every single *Berillo Spaghetti N.5 500G* purchase would repeat the same information over and over again.\n",
    "- **Handling**: Let's say you realize that there is an error in the column *Size* for the item *Berillo Spaghetti N.5 500G*. If the information is split into two tables, you can just correct it once, whereas if all the data was in the main **Transactions** table, you would need to look up all the *Berillo Spaghetti N.5 500G* transactions and modify them one by one. Not great for performance."
